    1. A C software interface (referred as "the interface" hereafter)
    2. A static and dynamic single-file library for x86_64 architecture

2. The software component interface shall implement the following data structures of ```generic type```:

    0. Array
    1. String
    2. Stack
    3. Queue
    4. Linked List
    5. Tree
    6. Heap
    7. Graph
    8. Hash Table
    9. Matrix
